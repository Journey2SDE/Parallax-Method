This project demonstrates the use of parallax scrolling effect on a webpage. Parallax scrolling is a technique where background images move at a different rate than the foreground content, creating an illusion of depth and immersion.

## Introduction

The project consists of a single HTML file (`index.html`) and a separate CSS file (`style.css`). The HTML file defines three sections, each with a parallax background image and content. The parallax effect is achieved using CSS properties and fixed background attachment.

## Features

- Three sections with parallax scrolling effect.
- Stylish heading and content for each section.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the content, background images, and styling to fit your own preferences. You can modify the CSS in the `style.css` file to change colors, fonts, or any other visual aspects.
